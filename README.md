# Maze Finder

Maze Finder is a two-player maze game created in Python using the Pygame library. In this game, two players control their own characters and race through a maze filled with moving and resizing walls. The goal is to reach the purple square first. The game runs for three rounds, and the player with the most wins becomes the overall winner.

## How to Play

- **Blue Player**: Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to move.
- **Green Player**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move.
- Avoid the red walls — some of them move and change size!
- Reach the purple square to win the round.
- The game displays the time for each player and keeps track of wins.
